## B. Project Topic Introduction
We are planning to implement a Neural Machine Translation using the Transformer Model for
translation of Japanese sentences to English. As of January 2020, Transformers are the dominant
architecture in NLP and are used to achieve state-of-the-art results for many tasks and it appears
as if they will be for the near future.
Recurrent neural networks are very slow to train and without LSTM the model is not very
accurate. But with LSTM, the model makes it much slower to train.We made the Seq2Seq model
as our baseline model but the performance was very low. To enhance the performance we are
using the Transformer model for our project.Attention is all you need: paper deals with English
to German and English to French and have shown the BLEU score of 28.1 and 41.0 respectively.
For Japanese to English we have implemented the state of art model and achieved a BLEU score
of 41.0.
